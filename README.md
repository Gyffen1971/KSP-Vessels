Location for SkyCrane Industries Vessels
We are the 9th Safest Space Administration.
This is where i will put all of my work during the creation of all vessels for KSP.
These vessels are being created to work with the Lastest Version of KSP and will be updated as time permits.
SCISA is current working on several different craft for Kerbal Space Program.

Here is a list of our current prjects.
  1.  Spaceplanes
  2.  Lifters (Limited Production)
  3.  Communication Satellites
  4.  Rovers (Limited Production)
  5.  Power Stations
    a. Space Based
    b. Land Based
  6.  Mining Bases (Very Limited Production)
  
Please visit our wiki https://github.com/Gyffen1971/KSP-Vessels/wiki for info on our craft.
I will try and update it as soon after a Vessel/Craft is released.
